Please help me figure out what needs updating. If you see anything that I've missed, please comment.

* World Tags - 40 new tags and roll changes from d6 and d10 (for up to 60 results) to d100
* Temperature - update table distribution but rolls stay the same
* Population - wording changes in table, rolls stay the same
* Tech Level - wording / distribution changes in table, rolls stay the same
* NPCs - several table changes based on the new 'One-Roll NPCs' content. Also:
** NPC manner / deal outcome - totally new table and rolls
** NPC motivation / want - overhaul of motivation table and rolls
** NPC power / hook - totally new table and rolls
* Alien social structure - modified table and rolls
* Alien physical features - these appear to have been moved to the new 'Beasts' content. It seems reasonable that each race of sentient aliens would get physical details from the Beasts table, and that an additional collection of beasts could be rolled up as well.
Completely New Stuff:

* Additional Points of Interest (local system features)
* Places
* Beasts
* Patrons
* Stats for human NPCs of specific classes
* Stats for robots & VIs
* Name generators
